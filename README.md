# What I learnt
I learnt how to use ARIA labels to enhance accessibity for users with hearing impediments. I aslo leant the importance of sectioning a HTML for a more legible structure. overall, I am more confident in using CSS with HTML, though there is ple nty more things I would like to impove and prcatise on.

# challenges
I found that researching codes that I hadn't used before proved to be quite time consuming, namely ARIA lables, however now that I have used it, I feel like and will be more confident using again in the future, though it is still something I would like to improve on. I also found learning to display items side by side quite challanign, though this was later solved thrugh trial and error.
